        <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
        <p><strong>Last Updated: December 25, 2025</strong></p>

        <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
        <p>Welcome to Webpot. These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your use of our website and the web development services provided by us. By accessing our website, purchasing a service plan (Starter, Basic, or Premium), or signing a contract with us, you agree to be bound by these Terms.</p>

        <h2>2. Definitions</h2>
        <p>"Company," "We," "Us," or "Our" refers to Webpot.</p>
        <p>"Client," "You," or "Your" refers to the entity or individual purchasing services from Webpot.</p>
        <p>"Project" refers to the web development work commissioned by the Client.</p>
        <p>"Deliverables" refers to the finished website, code, and design assets provided to the Client.</p>

        <h2>3. Services and Scope of Work</h2>
        <p>We provide web development services as described in our packages (Starter, Basic, Premium) or a custom proposal.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Scope:</strong> The specific deliverables (number of pages, SEO level, design style) are strictly limited to the package selected by the Client.</li>
            <li><strong>Scope Creep:</strong> Any additional features, pages, or changes requested by the Client outside the original agreement will incur additional charges.</li>
            <li><strong>Timelines:</strong> Delivery times (e.g., 7 days, 15 days) are estimates. These timelines commence only after we receive all necessary content (images, text, credentials) from the Client. Delays in Client feedback will result in delays in the final delivery.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. Client Obligations</h2>
        <p>To ensure the successful completion of the Project, you agree to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Provide all necessary text, images, logos, and other content within 3 business days of project kickoff.</li>
            <li>Grant us access to necessary hosting accounts, domain registrars, or other third-party services required for deployment.</li>
            <li>Review our work and provide feedback in a timely manner.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>5. Payments and Refunds</h2>
        <p><strong>Pricing:</strong> All prices listed on the website are in Indian Rupees (INR).</p>
        <p><strong>Payment Terms:</strong> A deposit (typically 50%) is required before work begins. The remaining balance is due upon project completion but prior to the final website handover/deployment.</p>
        <p><strong>Refund Policy:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>If you cancel the project before work has begun, you are eligible for a full refund.</li>
            <li>If you cancel the project after work has begun, the initial deposit is non-refundable to cover our time and resources.</li>
            <li>Once the website is deployed/live, no refunds will be issued.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>6. Intellectual Property (IP) Rights</h2>
        <p><strong>Client Ownership:</strong> Upon full payment of all invoices, the Client is granted full ownership of the finished website code and design.</p>
        <p><strong>Webpot Rights:</strong> We reserve the right to reuse underlying code snippets, libraries, or frameworks used in the development process for other projects.</p>
        <p><strong>Portfolio:</strong> You grant Webpot the right to display the finished Project in our portfolio, website, and marketing materials as a demonstration of our work.</p>

        <h2>7. Revisions</h2>
        <p>The number of revisions allowed is determined by your specific package. Standard revisions cover minor tweaks (colors, text changes, image swaps). Significant structural changes or design overhauls after the design phase has been approved will be billed at our standard hourly rate.</p>

        <h2>8. Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p><strong>Hosting & Domain:</strong> Unless explicitly stated in a custom contract, the Client is responsible for the purchase and renewal of domain names and web hosting.</p>
        <p><strong>Plugins/APIs:</strong> Costs for premium third-party themes, plugins, or APIs (e.g., payment gateways) are the responsibility of the Client.</p>

        <h2>9. Warranties and Liability</h2>
        <p><strong>No Guarantee:</strong> While we implement basic SEO and responsive design as per industry standards, we do not guarantee specific search engine rankings or sales numbers.</p>
        <p><strong>Limitation of Liability:</strong> Webpot shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, or consequential damages, including loss of data, loss of profits, or downtime caused by third-party hosting providers or malicious attacks (hacking).</p>

        <h2>10. Termination</h2>
        <p>We reserve the right to terminate a project if the Client is unresponsive for more than 30 days, uses abusive language, or fails to make payments. In such cases, the deposit is forfeited.</p>

        <h2>11. Governing Law</h2>
        <p>These Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of India. Any disputes arising under these Terms shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located in Gujarat/India.</p>
